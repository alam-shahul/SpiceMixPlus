# SpiceMix

![overview](./SpiceMix_overview.png)

SpiceMix is an unsupervised tool for analyzing data of the spatial transcriptome. SpiceMix models the observed expression of genes within a cell as a mixture of latent factors. These factors are assumed to have some spatial affinity between neighboring cells. The factors and affinities are not known a priori, but are learned by SpiceMix directly from the data, by an alternating optimization method that seeks to maximize their posterior probability given the observed gene expression. In this way, SpiceMix learns a more expressive representation of the identity of cells from their spatial transcriptome data than other available methods. 

SpiceMix can be applied to any type spatial transcriptomics data, including MERFISH, seqFISH, and HDST.

## Running SpiceMix

All code is contained within the SpiceMix folder. The script `main.py` runs the program -- see details for example usage.
